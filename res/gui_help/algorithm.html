<h3>Sequence Alignment Algorithm</h3>
<p>
  Sequence alignment is the process of aligning two or more sequences to be able to
  compare them. It can give us important information such as how similar different
  organisms are. Alignment is done by inserting gaps into the sequence, thus allowing
  bases/acids of one sequence match the base/acid of the other sequence.
