<h3>Protein</h3>
<p>
	Proteins are large biomolecules with complex structures that are constructed using RNA.
	Despite the complexity, a protein is just a sequence of amino acids. Its structure and
	function are determined by this sequence. Each amino acid is made from a one or more
	different codons. A codon is simply just a sequence of three bases. Each amino acid may
	be the result one, none, or many codons. Codons that don't correspond to an amino acid are
	called stop codons, which terminate the sequence.
