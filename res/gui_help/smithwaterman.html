<h3>Smith-Waterman</h3>
<p>
  This algorithm was developed by Temple F. Smith and Michael S.
  Waterman to determine similar regions between two sequences.
  It is a variation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, except that it
  opens up the possibility of local alignments. See the help menu for an example.
