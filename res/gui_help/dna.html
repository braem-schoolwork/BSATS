<h3>Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)</h3>
<p>
  DNA is a doubled stranded molecule that holds the genetic instructions used in the
  development, functionality, reproduction, and growth of an organism. For the purposes
  of sequencing, DNA is shown in a single sequence of the bases Guanine (G),
  Cytosine (C), Adenine (A), and Thymine (T).
