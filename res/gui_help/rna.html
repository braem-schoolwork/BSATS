<h3>Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)</h3>
<p>
  RNA is a single-stranded copy of a section of DNA, much like a recipe from a
  cookbook. Like DNA, it is essential for life. RNA uses the same
  bases, but Thymine (T) is replaced with Uracil (U). This is because Thymine is
  very stable, but Uracil is cheaper; DNA needs to be stable, whereas RNA is a
  short-lived copy, and thus does not need the extra stability. In some systems,
  RNA sequences are written with T instead of U because of the irrelevance in sequencing.
